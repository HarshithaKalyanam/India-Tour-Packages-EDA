# India Tour Packages – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing tour package data across India using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The goal is to understand travel trends, package pricing, destinations, and trip patterns using Python.

By analyzing the dataset, meaningful insights can be extracted to help travel agencies, tourists, and businesses understand tourism demand.

## Objectives
* Explore and understand the travel packages dataset
* Clean and preprocess the data
* Identify popular destinations
* Analyze package prices and duration
* Discover travel trends using visualizations

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about different travel packages such as:

* Package Name
* Destination
* Duration of trip
* Price
* Package Type
* Inclusions

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
Tour package dataset collected for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Formatting columns

### 3. Data Exploration
* Understanding dataset structure
* Checking distributions
* Identifying relationships

### 4. Data Visualization
Graphs and charts were created to understand trends.

### 5. Insights
Important conclusions were derived from the analysis.

## Key Insights
* Some destinations appear more frequently in travel packages.
* Package prices vary depending on duration and facilities.
* Certain trip durations are more popular among travelers.
